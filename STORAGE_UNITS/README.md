# üìò Flip-Flop Based Storage Unit ‚Äì RTL Reference Model for ASIC Memory

## üîé Overview

In RTL (Register Transfer Level) design for ASICs, we do **not directly code the physical memories** (like SRAMs, ROMs, CAMs, etc.). These memory components are **technology-specific IP blocks** provided by semiconductor foundries or standard cell libraries. They are highly optimized in terms of area, speed, and power, and are tailored for a particular process node (e.g., 7nm, 14nm, 28nm).

However, during the RTL development and simulation stages, we still need to **model the behavior** of these memory blocks. For this purpose, **flip-flop based storage units** are written in synthesizable RTL to emulate the memory functionality. These **reference models** are:

- Fully synthesizable.
- Behave like real memories (read/write interfaces, latencies, etc.).
- Used **only for simulation, verification, and synthesis**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Not Use Flip-Flop Memory in Final ASIC?

- Flip-flop based memory consumes **~10x more area** compared to specialized memory macros.
- Not optimized for power or performance like true memories.
- So, during the **Physical Design stage**, synthesis tools recognize these structures and replace them with **foundry-provided memory macros** through a process called **memory inference** or **macro replacement**.

## üß† Key Design Considerations

- Write and Read operations are synchronous.
- Storage modeled using 2D array of flip-flops (`reg [WIDTH-1:0] mem [DEPTH-1:0]`).
- Can be parameterized for different word widths and depths.
- Interface usually includes `clk`, `rst`, `write_en`, `read_en`, `addr`, `data_in`, `data_out`.
